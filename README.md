# CodeXam - Coding Challenge Platform

A web-based coding challenge platform similar to HackerRank or LeetCode that allows users to solve programming problems, submit solutions in multiple programming languages, and receive instant feedback through automated testing.

## 🚀 Features

- **Problem Browsing**: Browse coding problems by difficulty level
- **Multi-Language Support**: Write solutions in Python, JavaScript, Java, C++
- **Instant Feedback**: Get immediate PASS/FAIL/ERROR results
- **Submission History**: Track your progress and review past attempts
- **Leaderboard**: Compare your performance with other users
- **Admin Interface**: Easy problem creation and management
- **Secure Execution**: Sandboxed code execution with resource limits

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (Phase 1) → PostgreSQL (Phase 2)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Bootstrap CSS, Jinja2 Templates
- **Code Editor**: CodeMirror (planned)
- **Security**: Restricted execution environment with timeout/memory limits

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- SQLite (included with Python)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CodeXam.git
cd CodeXam
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Initialize Database
```bash
python init_db.py
```

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## ⚡ Quick Start

Want to try it right away? Here's the fastest way:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd CodeXam
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize with sample data
python init_db.py

# Run the app
python app.py
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5000` and start solving problems! 🚀

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The platform uses SQLite with the following main tables:

- **problems**: Stores coding problems with descriptions, test cases, and metadata
- **submissions**: Tracks user code submissions with results and performance metrics
- **users**: Basic user tracking for leaderboard functionality

### Database Commands

```bash
# Initialize database
python init_db.py

# Reset database (development only)
python reset_db.py

# View database statistics
python init_db.py --stats
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the database schema tests:
```bash
python test_database_schema.py
```
