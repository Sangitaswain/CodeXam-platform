# CodeXam - Fixes and Improvements Summary

## 🔧 Bug Fixes Applied

### 1. Missing Admin Route
**Issue**: Base template referenced `url_for('admin_panel')` but route didn't exist
**Fix**: Added placeholder admin route in `routes.py` that redirects to problems list with info message

### 2. Missing Static Image Files
**Issue**: Base template referenced favicon and image files that didn't exist
**Fix**: Created placeholder files in `static/img/` directory:
- `favicon.ico`
- `apple-touch-icon.png` 
- `og-image.png`
