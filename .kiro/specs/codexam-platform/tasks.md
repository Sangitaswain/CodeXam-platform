## Recommended Tech Stack

### Backend Framework
- **Flask** (Python) - Lightweight web framework
  - [Official Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
  - [Quick Start Guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/quickstart/)
  - **Justification**: Minimal setup, perfect for MVP, extensive documentation

### Database
- **SQLite** (Phase 1) → **PostgreSQL** (Phase 2)
  - [SQLite Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)
  - [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
  - **Justification**: Start free with SQLite, scale to PostgreSQL

### Frontend Stack
- **HTML5 + Bootstrap CSS** for responsive design
  - [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
- **Jinja2** templating engine
  - [Jinja2 Documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/)
- **CodeMirror** for code editing
  - [CodeMirror Documentation](https://codemirror.net/docs/)

### Code Execution
- **Multi-language support**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++
- **Security**: Subprocess execution with resource limits
- **Phase 2**: Docker containers or Judge0 API
  - [Judge0 API Documentation](https://ce.judge0.com/)
  - [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)

## Timeline and Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. **Foundation** → **Database** → **Judge Engine** → **Web Routes** → **Templates**
2. **Admin Features** and **Error Handling** can be developed in parallel
3. **Testing** should be integrated throughout development
4. **Sample Data** and **Final Integration** are final steps

### Risk Mitigation
- **Judge Engine Security**: Start with basic restrictions, enhance incrementally
- **Multi-language Support**: Implement Python first, add others iteratively
- **Code Editor Integration**: Use simple textarea initially, upgrade to CodeMirror
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize after core functionality is complete

### Team Considerations
- **Solo Developer**: 8 weeks full-time
- **Small Team (2-3)**: 4-6 weeks with parallel development
- **Larger Team**: 3-4 weeks with specialized roles
