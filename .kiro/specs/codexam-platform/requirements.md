# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CodeXam is a web-based coding challenge platform similar to HackerRank or LeetCode that allows users to solve programming problems, submit solutions in multiple programming languages, and receive instant feedback through automated testing. The platform provides a complete coding challenge experience with problem browsing, code editing, submission tracking, and result visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to browse available coding problems, so that I can select challenges that match my skill level and interests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display a list of all available coding problems
2. WHEN displaying problems THEN the system SHALL show the problem title, difficulty level, and brief description
3. WHEN a user clicks on a problem THEN the system SHALL navigate to the detailed problem view
4. IF there are no problems available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view detailed problem descriptions with examples, so that I can understand what needs to be implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a problem THEN the system SHALL display the complete problem description
2. WHEN showing problem details THEN the system SHALL include input format, output format, and sample test cases
3. WHEN displaying the problem THEN the system SHALL show the expected function signature (e.g., `def solution(a, b):`)
4. WHEN viewing a problem THEN the system SHALL provide sample input and expected output examples

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write and edit code in multiple programming languages in a web interface, so that I can implement solutions in my preferred language without leaving the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a problem THEN the system SHALL provide a code input area with language selection (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.)
2. WHEN a user selects a language THEN the system SHALL update the code editor with appropriate syntax highlighting and function template
3. WHEN editing code THEN the system SHALL preserve the user's input during the session
4. WHEN the code editor loads THEN the system SHALL pre-populate with the required function signature for the selected language
5. IF the user clears the editor THEN the system SHALL allow them to restore the original template for that language

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to submit my code and receive instant feedback, so that I can know immediately if my solution is correct.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits code THEN the system SHALL execute the code against hidden test cases
2. WHEN code execution completes THEN the system SHALL return one of three results: PASS, FAIL, or ERROR
3. WHEN code passes all tests THEN the system SHALL display a success message with "‚úÖ PASS"
4. WHEN code fails any test THEN the system SHALL display "‚ùå FAIL" without revealing test case details
5. WHEN code has syntax or runtime errors THEN the system SHALL display "üõë ERROR" with error message
6. WHEN code execution takes too long THEN the system SHALL timeout and return an error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see my submission history, so that I can track my progress and review previous attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits code THEN the system SHALL store the submission with timestamp and result
2. WHEN viewing submission history THEN the system SHALL display all past submissions for each problem
3. WHEN showing submissions THEN the system SHALL include submission time, result status, and code snippet
4. WHEN a user has no submissions THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the system to safely execute user code in multiple languages, so that malicious code cannot harm the server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing user code THEN the system SHALL use secure execution environments (sandboxed containers or trusted execution services)
2. WHEN code attempts dangerous operations THEN the system SHALL prevent access to file system, network, and system operations
3. WHEN code execution begins THEN the system SHALL enforce memory and time limits for each supported language
4. IF code execution exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL terminate execution and return an error
5. WHEN supporting multiple languages THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate execution environments for Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify myself by name, so that my submissions can be tracked without complex authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first visits THEN the system SHALL prompt for a display name
2. WHEN a name is provided THEN the system SHALL associate all submissions with that name
3. WHEN viewing submissions THEN the system SHALL show which user made each submission
4. IF no name is provided THEN the system SHALL use "Anonymous" as the default identifier

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a leaderboard of top performers, so that I can compare my progress with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users complete problems THEN the system SHALL track the number of problems solved per user
2. WHEN displaying the leaderboard THEN the system SHALL rank users by number of problems solved
3. WHEN showing rankings THEN the system SHALL display user name and problem count
4. WHEN multiple users have the same score THEN the system SHALL order by earliest completion time

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to easily add new coding problems, so that the platform can grow with fresh content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding problems THEN the system SHALL support a structured format for problem definition
2. WHEN defining problems THEN the system SHALL include test inputs and expected outputs
3. WHEN problems are added THEN the system SHALL automatically make them available in the problem list
4. WHEN test cases are defined THEN the system SHALL support multiple input/output pairs per problem
